## Major/New Features

3.5 is a smaller release to lay the groundwork for major new features
described in [Spree Development Roadmap](https://github.com/spree/spree/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).
It also contains number of bug fixes and improvements besides described in this document.

### Spree Backend views exporter

You can easily copy all of the default spree views into
your project with just one command line:

```bash
rails g spree:backend:copy_views
```

We hope will make backend customization easier.
